title: "Helping out"
---

These projects are ones which have given talks to us or taken us out on excursions, 
and which are all looking for volunteers to help out in various ways.

Some are **local**, requiring you to go outside, count birds, set up boxes, etc.
Others are **online**, in which you can participate from the comfort of your own 
home. 

See what appeals to you!
