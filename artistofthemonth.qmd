## Artist of the Month

Starting in 2025, Westman Naturalists will be featuring an artist each month to recognize their work in the natural world! Are you a photographer, a painter, a singer, a sculptor, a wood carver, a dancer, or...? And does your work involve nature? Then send us a message to be featured!
