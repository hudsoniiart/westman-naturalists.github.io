## Welcome!

We are a group of amateur naturalists with the goal of exploring and enjoying the natural beauty and history of south-western Manitoba, Canada. From wildlife to wildflowers and everything in between. Come experience what Westman has to offer!

## {.notice}
Given the improved situation in Manitoba, Westman Naturalists is starting outdoor events, with limited capacity. We continue to offer online content here, on Facebook and via email. See our outdoor events as well as live online presentations on the ([Events](events.html)) page.
